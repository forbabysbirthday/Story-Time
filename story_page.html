            <h2>Puppet</h2>
            <p>
                Before everything, Ferb's life was like a never ending loop. Each day he felt like a replay of previous.
                Like waking up, attending classes, returning home and starting all over again.
                His felt like he is just another regular college student. There were no excitement just the time that felt like it will go forever.
            </p>

            <h2>Meeting</h2>
            <p>
                One day, he just met her on online platform. She was like a burst of color in his black and white world. Even though all he was seeing nothing yet he felt connected and talked throught out the night with her.
                For the first time ferd felt alive as if he was not just regular but special. She made him believe in himself. He saw the world with different angle. With her those days where no longer a routine but they were adventure filled with laughter, connection and hope.
                Fred's world revolved around her and for a while everything felt perfect for him. She brought out the best in him and he wanted to be the best for her. She pretty much became the painter of him life coloring every single corner.
            </p>

            <h2>The crack</h2>
            <p>
                As their anniversary approached, things changed one night as they were planning it. As fred was a college student, he didnt had so much money in his pocket. She asked him how much money should she bring, fred thinking she is here in his not to great time of him life financially.
                He replied with certain money. After that she confessed that she felt embrassed that he was asking for money on their anniversary. She then compaired fred to someone else, someone with a busniess and how he brings gifts to someone she knows. The weight of her words hit him and what fred though about her.
                The bubble of happiness that he was in was shattered immediatly. For the first time, fred felt not enought for her as the love and connection they shared was no longer enough.
            </p>

            <h2>Letting go</h2>
            <p>
                Fred made a decission that night as he wanted her to feel special, to be happy with someone who could give her the life she deserve. If that meant letting her go, so be it. It was hard as he saw her like a godess in his life. But he believed it was the right thing for her.
                He prayed that night, what ever happened to him he would not care but for her, fred prayed for her well being and that she would find someone who would take better care of her than fred ever did.
            </p>

            <h2>After math</h2>
            <p>
                Fred now found himself in a phase of heartbreak. Squeezing his neck with the absence of her and her sweet words. As he reflect on his life before her, he realized that while she brough meaning and color to his world, he must now learn to paint his world by himself.
                Upcoming days were unpredictable but fred knows he has what she taught to rebuild him self, to find joy in his own way.
            </p>

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                Fred's story ends here, he is still learning what his meaning in his own life is. He is no longer a puppet but he is a writer of his own story.
                He is learning to find special within himself.
            </p>
